# cloudofficeprint-python
This project provides a Python interface for Cloud.

# Installation
To install the Cloud Python package, you can type in your terminal:  
`pip install cloudofficeprint`

You also need to have the requests-library installed (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). This can be installed through your terminal:  
`pip install requests`

# Usage
1. Create a template (docx, xlsx, pptx, HTML, md, txt, csv), for the possible tags, click [here](http://www.cloudofficeprint.com/docs/#templates).
2. Create the input data with this Python SDK
3. Send template and data to an Cloud Office Print server and save the response to a file with this Python SDK

To see the JSON-data that is sent to the Cloud Office Print server, you can turn on verbose-mode by setting the argument `cop_verbose` to `True` when creating a `PrintJob`.

# Quickstart: Hello World example
## Template (docx)
<img src="./imgs/hello_world_template.png" width="600" />
<!-- TODO: change this link to Github link -->

## Data
The data can be generated by the Python SDK:
```python
import cloudofficeprint as cop

# Main object that holds the data
collection = cop.elements.ElementCollection()

# Create the title element and add it to the element collection
title = cop.elements.Property(
    name='title',
    value='Hello World!'
)
collection.add(title)

# Create the text element and add it to the element collection
text = cop.elements.Property(
    name='text',
    value='This is an example created with the Cloud Office Print Python SDK'
)
collection.add(text)
...
```

## Cloud Office Print server
The template and the data need to be sent to an Cloud Office Print server that merges both. This can be done by setting up the configuration for Cloud Office Print server and passing it to the print job instance. You can get your API key by signing up at https://www.cloudofficeprint.com.
```python
...
SERVER_URL = "https://api.cloudofficeprint.com/"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace by your own API key

# Add server
server = cop.config.Server(
    SERVER_URL,
    cop.config.ServerConfig(api_key=API_KEY)
)

# Create print job
printjob = cop.PrintJob(
    data=collection,
    server=server,
    template=cop.Resource.from_local_file('PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE'),
)

# Execute print job and save response to file
response = printjob.execute()
response.to_file('PATH_OF_OUTPUT_FILE')
```

## Result

# Other examples
Going through the other examples is also recommended as this gives you a good idea on how to use the SDK. The current examples are:
- order_confirmation_example.py
- pdfsignature_example.py
- solar_system_example.py
- spacex_example.py (the most extensive example)
- multiple_request_merge_example.py

The examples can be found in the parent directory of the project on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-python). Each example also has its own folder containing the used templates, the generated output files and a markdown file with explanation when needed.

# Documentation

The documentation for this SDK can be found inside the `docs/cloudofficeprint/` folder on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-python). If you want to generate this documentation yourself, you can run the following command (after installing pdoc: `pip install pdoc3`) in the project directory:  
`pdoc --html --force --output-dir docs/ cloudofficeprint/`

The full Cloud documentation can be found at the [Cloud Office Print docs](https://www.cloudofficeprint.com/docs/).

# Tests 
To check if everything works, you can run the tests.

## Running the tests
1. Open a terminal in the parent directory of this project, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-python).
2. Type in the terminal: `python test.py`
3. The tests succeeded if nothing is printed to the terminal

# Contributing

## Useful VS Code extensions
- `njpwerner.autodocstring`: Python docstring generator, uses Google-style docs by default.

## pdoc
[pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) is used for documentation generation.
Things to keep in mind when writing docs (some of these are non-standard):
- Docstrings are inherited from `super()`.
- Instance variables (attributes) can have docstrings, start the docstring on the line *underneath* the attribute
- For `@property` properties, the setter's documentation is ignored. Make sure everything is in the getter.
- You can use markdown in the docstrings, along with the generated google-style docs.
  - Doing something like \``ClassName`\` (with backticks, which are generally for inline code) makes pdoc look for the reference and try to hyperlink it in the generated docs.</br>
  This works with any object, useful methods or instance variables of a class too.
