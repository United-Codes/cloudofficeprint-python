# apexofficeprint-python
This project provides a Python interface for APEX Office Print.

# Installation
To install the APEX Office Print Python package, you can type in your terminal:  
`pip install apexofficeprint`

You also need to have the requests-library installed (https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). This can be installed in your terminal:  
`pip install requests`

# Usage
1. Create a template (docx, xlsx, pptx, HTML, md, txt, csv)
2. Create the input data with this Python SDK
3. Send template and data to an AOP server and save the response to a file with this Python SDK

To see the JSON-data that is sent to the AOP server, you can turn on verbose-mode by running your Python program with the `--verbose` argument like this:
```python
python my_file.py --verbose
```

# Quickstart: Hello World example
## Template (docx)
<img src="./imgs/hello_world_template.png" width="600" />
<!-- TODO: change this link to Github link -->

## Data
The data can be generated by the Python SDK:
```python
import apexofficeprint as aop

# Main object that holds the data
collection = aop.elements.ElementCollection()

# Create the title element and add it to the element collection
title = aop.elements.Property(
    name='title',
    value='Hello World!'
)
collection.add(title)

# Create the text element and add it to the element collection
text = aop.elements.Property(
    name='text',
    value='This is an example created with the AOP Python SDK'
)
collection.add(text)
...
```

## AOP server
The template and the data need to be sent to an AOP server that merges both. This can be done by setting up the AOP server and creating a print job in the same Python file:
```python
...
SERVER_URL = "https://api.apexofficeprint.com/"
API_KEY = "{YOUR_API_KEY}"

# Add server
server = aop.config.Server(
    SERVER_URL,
    aop.config.ServerConfig(api_key=API_KEY)
)

# Create print job
printjob = aop.PrintJob(
    template=aop.Resource.from_local_file('PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE'),
    data=collection,
    server=server
)

# Execute print job and save response to file
response = printjob.execute()
response.to_file('PATH_OF_OUTPUT_FILE')
```

## Result
<img src="./imgs/hello_world_output.png" width="600" />

# Other examples
We also made some bigger examples. The current examples are:
- order_confirmation_example.py
- pdfsignature_example.py
- solar_system_example.py
- spacex_example.py (the most extensive example)

The examples can be found in the parent directory of the project on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/apexofficeprint-python). Each example also has its own folder containing the used templates, the generated output files and a markdown file with explanation when needed.

# Documentation
The documentation for this SDK can be seen by double clicking the file `index.html` in the folder `docs/apexofficeprint/` on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/apexofficeprint-python).

The full APEX Office Print documentation can be found at the [AOP docs](http://www.apexofficeprint.com/docs/).

# Tests
To check if everything works, you can run the tests.

## How to run the tests
1. Open a terminal in the parent directory of this project, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/apexofficeprint-python).
2. Type in the terminal: `python test.py`
3. The tests succeeded if nothing is printed to the terminal

# Contributing

## Useful VS Code extensions
- `njpwerner.autodocstring`: Python docstring generator, uses Google-style docs by default.

## pdoc
[pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) is used for documentation generation.
Things to keep in mind when writing docs (some of these are non-standard):
- Docstrings are inherited from `super()`.
- Instance variables (attributes) can have docstrings, start the docstring on the line *underneath* the attribute
- For `@property` properties, the setter's documentation is ignored. Make sure everything is in the getter.
- You can use markdown in the docstrings, along with the generated google-style docs.
  - Doing something like \``ClassName`\` (with backticks, which are generally for inline code) makes pdoc look for the reference and try to hyperlink it in the generated docs.</br>
  This works with any object, useful methods or instance variables of a class too.
